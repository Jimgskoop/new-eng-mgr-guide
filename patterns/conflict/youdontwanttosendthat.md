**Definition:** You (don't) want to send that

**Implementation:** If you really want to send an angry email, that's a clear
signal you shouldn't send an email.  Sit on it for an hour.  If you still
really want to send it after an hour ... sit on it for another hour.  Repeat
as necessary.

**Reasoning:** It's hard to take communication back.  If you're really
emotional it's going to impact your ability to communicate effectively.  You're
almost always going to be better off waiting to communicate about an issue
so important that it can make you angry until you're no longer angry.

Pro-tip: If you're tempted to send an email all in caps, that's probably a good
indication you shouldn't.
