**Definition:** If in the midst of conflict, consider changing venue

**Implementation:** A change of scenery can dislodge communication and
conflict patterns.  

**Reasoning:** Whatever you've been doing until now hasn't worked.  Time to
change things.

If you've been talking in a room, consider taking a walk around the building
or on a nature trail if it's available.  Maybe go get a cup of coffee.  
Change the physical environment in which you've been having this conflict --
sometimes, a change of scenery is literally all it takes to see things from
a new perspective.
