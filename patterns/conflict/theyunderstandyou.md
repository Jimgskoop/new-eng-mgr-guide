**Definition:** When in disagreements, listen rather than talk

**Implementation:** When trying to resolve disagreements, emphasize listening
skills rather than attempting to explain your position better.

**Reasoning:** When two or more parties are in disagreement, all parties
naturally assume they're right; when, further, parties assume good will on the
part of the people with whom they're in disagreement, it's easy to assume
the issue is simply that you've not explained yourself well enough -- after all,
they're smart people, and you're right, so if only you could explain again, or
better, they'll understand they were wrong.

That's an impass pattern, because then potentially both parties are no longer
re-assessing their own stance, but rather doubling down on their position and
no longer actively engaging in attempting to resolve the disagreement.

Instead, consider as an exercise trying to operate for a few moments as though
*you* are wrong, and attempt to listen from that perspective.  Ask more
questions.  Consider actively trying to prove the wrongness of your position.

In addition to potentially dislodging you from an incorrect position,
doing this demonstrates to the other party that you're trying to come to
agreement rather than trying to further cudgel them with your opinion.
