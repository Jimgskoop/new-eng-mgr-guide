**Definition:** Upgrade to higher-bandwidth communication channels

**Implementation:** Different communication channels have more or less ability
to carry richer levels of communication (such as facial expressions, body
language).  When in conflict using a given communication channel, attempt to
use a higher-bandwidth channel to resolve the conflict.  Repeat as necessary.

**Reasoning:** It's hard to really communicate when all you've got is typed
text.  That's why phones are better than text -- you get voice intonations --
and teleconferencing is better than phones -- you get facial expressions --
and face-to-face communication is highest-bandwidth.

When a disagreement starts at a certain bandwidth level, upgrade the bandwidth
level as soon as possible, and as high as practicable.  Argument started in
email and it's with someone on the other side of the floor? Get up, walk over,
and chat in person.  Are they in another part of the country? Time for
a teleconference.
