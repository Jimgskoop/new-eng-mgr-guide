**Definition:** Honor the chain of command

**Implementation:** Loop in your manager before you make any significant communications to other parts of the company, outside your immediate org and/or reporting chain.. 

**Do:** Give your manager a heads-up about any strong emails or other types of communication you may make that has the potential to go up your reporting chain.

**Reasoning:** Warning your manager about any important communications you're making helps her from feeling blindsided by your passionate rantings, and also avoids her getting frantic emails or texts from _her_ manager.

**Ways This Fails:** If you don't warn your manager beforehand, she will feel blindsided by your actions.
