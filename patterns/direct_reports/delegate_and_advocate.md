**Definition:** Delegate and Advocate.  To delegate is to assign responsibilities to your direct report; she then acts as your agent or deputy.  To advocate is to support your direct report as they carry out the tasks you've assigned to them.

**Implementation:** Leverage your directs by involving them in decision-making, whether it's technical, organizational, etc.  Make sure to give them opportunities to learn and grow their leadership skills.

**Do:** Don't try to do everything yourself.  Give tasks to your reports.  Engage them in writing user stories.  Don't tell them how to solve a problem, allow them the space to figure things out on their own.  Let them fail, but help get them back on their feet afterwards.

**Reasoning:** Since you can't do everything yourself, you need to figure out how to scale your efforts by leveraging others.  Giving your directs tasks and responsibilities will help them develop their own leadership abilities, plus grow their influence and visibility within the team and the company.  Supporting your report as she performs these tasks will empower her with the authority to make her own decisions.  The best success as a manager is to make yourself obsolete, so identifying a lieutenant who you can groom into your replacement will allow you to move on to new/different challenges.

**Ways This Fails:** Since you probably have a lot of expertise and knowledge, you might feel that it's easier to just do the work yourself, rather than helping someone else do it.  This bad habit makes you overloaded, plus you're stealing growth opportunities from your reports.  Giving them responsibilities, but then not supporting them -- or micromanaging them -- as they attempt to do the work undermines their autonomy and sets them up for failure.
