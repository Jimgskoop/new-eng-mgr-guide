**Definition:** 1o1s, or One-on-One meetings, are meetings with *exactly* two participants

**Implementation:** Scheduled 1o1s should be relatively frequent (weekly to
bi-weekly), and at least 30 minutes long.

**Do:** Schedule and keep regular 1o1s with direct reports.  

**Reasoning:** Keeping regular 1o1s with direct reports helps make sure
you both have an opportunity to share information and context with each other,
as well as providing a last-resort 'garbage collection' opportunity for anything
worth discussing that had not been discussed through ad-hoc methods.

Your DRs could quickly start developing the perception you're busy, and that
it's hard to find time to catch up.  By creating regular catchup opportunities
and consistently adhering to them, you deliver the clear message that being
in sync with your DRs is a high priority, non-negotiable, desire for you.  

**Ways This Fails:** Since 1o1s become ordinary and well-scheduled, you can
develop the temptation to, when busy, postpone or cancel, and "we'll catch up
next time".  Barring vacations or people being out of the office, resist this
urge.  The logical end result of this are 1o1s which are scheduled weekly but
happen once a quarter.  Every time you cancel a 1o1 you deliver a message about
priority to the person with whom you had that 1o1.
