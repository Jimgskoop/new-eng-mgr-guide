**Definition:** Meet regularly with your Business Partners

**Implementation:** Scheduled recurring meetings with your business partners and project stakeholders should happen biweekly or monthly, 30-60 minutes long.

**Do:** Schedule and keep regular, recurring meetings with any business partners and project stakeholders.

**Reasoning:** Meeting regularly with business partners and project stakeholders ensures there is good high-level communication and context about the status of projects or teams.  Use this time to trade information about project timelines, milestones, resourcing/staffing, interdependencies, or other issues.  Build a relationship with your partners, and let them know that you are serving as their advocate within your functional organization.

**Ways This Fails:** Don't skip these meetings.  Don't wait to communicate a slip on a project milestone the week before it's due.  Don't give the impression that your hands are tied with respect to larger/broader company forces (e.g. "I simply can't get you another engineer because there are other more-pressing staffing priorities....")
